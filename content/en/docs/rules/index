2016 Rules
==========

[<img class="left" src="/resources/2015/rulebook.png" />](/resources/2015/rulebook.pdf)

The rules, regulations and specifications for the SR 2016 competition will be
released at [Kickstart](/events/kickstart) 2016. Up until then, the competition game is a secret.

You can read last year's [rulebook](/resources/2015/rulebook.pdf) or find out more about
[previous games](/schools/game) which have been played to get an idea
of the competition regulations. Some of these regulations may be changed for
the 2016 competition.
